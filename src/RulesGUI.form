              <text value="OBJECTIVE: &#10;&#10;Rainbow can be played in solitary or by a group. The group version simply consists of a number of players playing the solitary version simultaneously, with the highest score winning. I'll explain the solitary version, since that's what the applet lets you play. &#10;&#10;The game consists of 15 rounds. In each round, you roll the dice and then score the roll in one of 15 categories. You must score once in each category -- which means that towards the end of the game you may have to settle for scoring zero in some categories. The score is determined by a different rule for each category. &#10;&#10;The object of the game is to maximize your total score. The game ends once all 15 categories have been scored. &#10;&#10; &#10;&#10;&#10;ROLLING THE DICE: &#10;&#10;You have five dice which you can roll, represented by the die faces at the top of the applet window. To start with, you roll all dice by clicking on the Roll All button. After you roll all dice, you can either score the current roll, or re-roll any or all of the five dice. &#10;&#10;To re-roll some of the dice, click on the toggle button underneath the die face you want to re-roll, then click on the Re-roll button. This will re-roll the selected dice, leaving the unselected ones unchanged. &#10;&#10;You can roll the dice a total of three times -- the initial roll (in which you must roll all the dice), plus two re-rolls of any or all dice. After rolling four times, you must score the roll. &#10;&#10;Once you've scored the roll, you roll all the dice again and repeat the process. You continue until all 15 categories have been filled, at which time the game is over. &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10;&#10;SCORING: &#10;&#10;Once you have the dice face combination you want to score, you score the roll in one of the 15 categories. You do this by clicking on one of the radio buttons in either the Upper Scores or Lower Scores box. Once a category has been scored, it is closed out for the rest of the game; you cannot change a category's score once it's been set. Each category defines its own scoring rules, as described below. &#10; &#10;&#10;UPPER SCORES &#10;&#10;In the upper scores, you total only the number of specified die face. Below is a list of the point values associated with each color in the rainbow. &#10;&#10;Red       1pt &#10;&#10;Orange    2pt &#10;&#10;Yellow    3pt &#10;&#10;Green     4pt &#10;&#10;Blue      5pt &#10;&#10;Indigo    6pt &#10;&#10;Violet    7pt &#10;&#10; &#10;BONUS &#10;&#10;If you score 84 points or higher (an average of 3 of each color) in the upper section, you get a 35 point bonus! &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;LOWER SCORES &#10;&#10;In the lower scores, you score either a set amount (defined by the category), or zero if you don't satisfy the category requirements. &#10;&#10;4 &amp; 5 OF A COLOR : For 4 of a Color, you must have at least four of the same die faces. If so, you total all the die faces and score that total. Similarly for 5 of a Color, except that you must have 5 of the 7 die faces the same.  &#10;&#10;&#10;PRIMARY&#10;&#10;Score 25 points if you roll Primary – a combination of colors yellow, red, and blue. If you score multiple Primaries, you get 25 points multiplied by the number of Primaries you've scored!&#10;&#10;&#10;SECONDARY&#10;&#10;Score 25 points if you roll Secondary – a combination of colors green, orange, and violet. If you score multiple Secondaries, you get 25 points multiplied by the number of Secondaries you've scored!&#10; &#10;&#10;WARM PALLET&#10;&#10;Score 30 points if you roll a Warm pallet – a combination of colors red, orange, and yellow. If you score multiple Warm Pallets, you get 30 points multiplied by the number of Warm Pallets you've scored!&#10; &#10;&#10;COLD PALLET &#10;&#10;Score 40 points if you roll Cold pallet – a combination of colors green, blue, indigo, and violet. If you score multiple Cold Pallets, you get 40 points multiplied by the number of Cold Pallets you've scored!&#10; &#10;&#10;CHANCE &#10;&#10;Chance is the catch-all roll. You can roll anything and you simply total all the die faces values. &#10; &#10;&#10;RAINBOW &#10;&#10;A Rainbow is when you roll all seven colors of the rainbow and it scores 50 points. "/>
